# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Welcome to my Work Day Scheduler Website. It is a simple calender app that can be used for scheduling your work day.
Using the standard hours of 9am to 5pm, whatever the current hour is, it will be highlighted in Red. Anything after the current hour is coloured Green and anything prior to the current hour is in grey. Any task you write will be saved even when you refresh the page as it is stored in local storage. 

Due to time constraint, my code is longer than it needs to be although completely functional. You will find that the buttons and text boxes were created individually, rather than in an array. 

Here is a screenshot of the app:
